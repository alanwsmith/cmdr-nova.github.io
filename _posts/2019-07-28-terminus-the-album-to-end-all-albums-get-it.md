<p>Or not, because this <em>definitely</em> is not my last album.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Earlier this year, almost immediately after I released <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="ReKall (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eyeshadow2600fm.bandcamp.com/album/rekall" target="_blank">ReKall</a> (which is still rising in popularity, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="especially on Spotify  (opens in a new tab)" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5xHPLsmqW46M91z04BKvYq" target="_blank">especially on Spotify</a>, where I've currently hit over 2000 monthly streams), I hatched an idea for my very next album (and yes, I already have my ideas for the album that comes after this one!)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For a seriously, <em>really </em>long time, I've been a huge fan of the Mass Effect series. So much so that I actually wrote about how I feel <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Mass Effect 2 is a Cyberpunk masterpiece over on Pastel Wasteland (opens in a new tab)" href="http://pastelwasteland.com/showcase/mass-effect-2-cyberpunk-masterpiece/" target="_blank">Mass Effect 2 is a cyberpunk masterpiece, over on Pastel Wasteland</a>. And Terminus, the next Eyeshadow 2600 FM album that releases on October 25th, is a direct result of that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And I mean <em>direct</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the opening track, '<strong>Omega</strong>', and its follow-up, '<strong>More Human Than Human</strong>', to the emotionally charged, '<strong>Her Blue Girlfriend</strong>' all the way to the end with '<strong>Subject Zero</strong>' and '<strong>From Memories Long Ago</strong>'‚ÄîAll subsequently calling back to things many people have probably absolutely forgotten about by now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This album much less follows the direct story-line of Mass Effect, though, but more follows a future memory of things that may or may not have happened. Memories from the mind of a hollow shadow‚ÄîA construction who once was, and can never be again, the savior of the Milky Way Galaxy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So far, Terminus has two singles available, along with corresponding remixes, bonus content, and music videos. The first, being '<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="More Human Than Human (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eyeshadow2600fm.bandcamp.com/album/more-human-than-human" target="_blank">More Human Than Human</a>', and the second, '<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Omega (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eyeshadow2600fm.bandcamp.com/album/omega" target="_blank">Omega</a>.'</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if that wasn't enough, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="the full album is now also available for pre-order (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eyeshadow2600fm.bandcamp.com/album/terminus-2" target="_blank">the full album is now also available for pre-order</a>, direct from Bandcamp.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But before this album releases and I move on to what comes next, we've got one more single headed this way before October. A single featuring synthy vibes, vocals and even a guitar solo?! <strong><em>Yes</em></strong>. Another first for Eyeshadow 2600 FM!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That's just it though. The entirety of Terminus has been nothing but nonstop firsts for my music, and new directions I never even thought I'd be able to go, and yet, here we are.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Welcome</em></strong>, to the end of the beginning.</p>
