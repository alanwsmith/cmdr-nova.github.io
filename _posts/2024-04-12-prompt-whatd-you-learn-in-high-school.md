<p>I don't always jump into the Jetpack writing prompts, because most of the time they're kind of "Eh." Kind of boring, etc, etc, you know what I mean. But this one is interesting, because you could answer this a few different ways.</p>

<p>I could say, I learned in high school that I only learn by doing. I can't sit in front of a teacher and a book and learn anything. I just don't parse things in that way. It was so bad that, my math teacher in high school noticed that I was falling behind in advanced algebra, and instead of helping me, and figuring out how best to catch me up with everyone else ... she placed me in a remedial math class to learn how to balance a checkbook.</p>

<p>But, as someone who elected to go to vocational school, I was <em>originally</em> going for computer science. And I got one full year of Visual Basic, before I had to switch to a completely different school district ... wherein that same class was filled up, and I wasn't able to join. So, I was made to enter into business technology. You know, learning Microsoft Excel. I kind of blame the aforementioned math teacher, and the class I wanted to be in, being full, as to why I'm not working in a tech field, a field I <em>should absolutely be in by now</em>.</p>

<p>Being hard-headed, and dead-set on things I want to do, regardless of whether those opportunities were offered to me, I spent <em>most</em> of my time in BTA teaching myself how to write HTML. The teacher would ask for an example of a Microsoft Access database, and in order to get back to what I was teaching myself, I would print out the example database from the back of the book, and hand it in. And he'd be none-the-wiser. <em>Literally.</em></p>

<p>Mr. Manning, if you're reading this today, I'm not sorry. I didn't want to be in your class, and you didn't teach anyone a damn thing. I wanted to be in computer science, I wanted to be a sysadmin, and that's not where I'm at right now, and I blame the school, and the school district for not working with me enough to help me be where I needed and wanted to be, <em>for my future</em>.</p>

<p>I guess you could say, what I learned in high school, is how to do things for myself, for my <em>own</em> future, because nobody else is going to help you get there, but you. And I'm <em>still</em> working on getting there. I don't give up, not on anything.</p>
