<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other day, I wrote about how I'd thought of changing my name in music altogether, and starting over, fresh. How I wasn't sure if I really wanted to do that. Well, <em>instead</em> of wiping the slate clean, I've decided to simply make a secondary project, under the name <em>PLEXX</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eyeshadow 2600 FM does and will still exist, and may even continue to serve more new albums! But, with the direction of PLEXX, we're talking more of a slow, chilled out, horror-vapor sort of situation. That's not entirely too far off from the roots of what I've done before--synthwave, darksynth, ambient--and that's just fine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vaporwave is fundamentally different in its creation process, where, sure, you'll have instruments, but there is a lot more sampling involved. And with sampling, opens up the door for some ... fun.</p>

<p>Enter, my upcoming album, <em><strong>disc eRROR 19.92 ~DE-LUX</strong></em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://plexx.bandcamp.com/album/disc-error-1992-de-lux" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Up for preorder now</a>, mostly so that I can <em>have</em> the page visible to visitors, but I entirely plan on having the album done by the first of August, if not earlier. It depends on how much time and energy I have in correlation with my offline work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, I have to cut this update a bit short, <em>because I have to go get ready to leave for that offline job.</em></p>

<p>Welcome to PLEXX.</p>
