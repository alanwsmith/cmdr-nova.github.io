<p>A lot of the times, at least when I'm in <strong>Sims 4</strong>, I have a tendency to start new games over and over again, without any clear goals as to what I want to do. Not even most of the challenges can make it easy for me to finally just <em>stick</em> with something. Part of this is due to the fact that my original game was <em>awesome</em>, but I messed it up with too much modding and game-altering with things like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="MCCC (opens in a new tab)" href="https://deaderpool-mccc.com/#/releases" target="_blank">MCCC</a> (a mod I would highly recommend for story progression, and especially this challenge, at least, if you want your offspring to make their own lives without your intervention).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, in the spirit of my original game, and in order to give myself hundreds of hours of game-play, I wrote up a challenge loosely based around <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="the Legacy Challenge (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.simslegacychallenge.com/the-sims-4-legacy-challenge-rules/" target="_blank">the Legacy Challenge</a>, except much, <em>much</em> longer, completely ridiculous, and based on <em>real</em> events that took place in my original game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The challenge itself is much too large to paste into this blog post, so I have it <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="hosted here via my Google Drive (opens in a new tab)" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=102pZUHbhNK7YT6r1qWxO5pvJasQBiQDJjOz4FlTlzio" target="_blank">hosted here via my Google Drive</a> where you can read up on how to get started, and what's expected in order to complete it (this challenge will likely take you a minimum of 500 some in-game hours to even come close to finishing).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be sure to use the <strong>#VampHouseChallenge</strong> hashtag on the Sims 4 gallery to download some starting homes, or sims, and save what you make there if you like! I will surely check them out and maybe even introduce new sims into my own game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the biggest things about this, though, is that it is based on your main founder sims both being vampires, but not before you've had one child to a random sim in the world whom you will later <em>divorce</em>. That's just one of the pieces of drama that you're required to create in order to finish sections of this challenge. Another piece being the death of a sibling during a particular wedding, and a basement dedicated to the murder of random sims, <em>including the<strong> Landgraabs</strong></em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And this is all before you make it to part two of the challenge, the <em><strong>vampire hunting</strong></em> section.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Technically you could play and complete part one and call it a day, but this challenge is, as mentioned earlier, designed to be a long-road sort of game that takes you <em>forever </em>to complete. Without further ado, though,<strong> enjoy</strong>! (and let me know if you have any issues with this challenge, as I'll be revising and updating as needed)</p>

<p>Here's what you'll find from me in the  <strong>#VampHouseChallenge</strong> hashtag on the gallery, in order to help get you started (if you like):</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Morgan Karga</strong>, the original 'vampire spouse' from the game that inspired this challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":77,"width":539,"height":519} -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Donovan Karga</strong>, an alternate male variation of Morgan Karga, for those who aren't interested in a female spouse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":78,"width":533,"height":509} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized"><img src="http://cmdr-nova.online/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-78" style="width:533px;height:509px"/></figure>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>An 1800 simolean</strong> starter 'home' for the Bargain Bend lot, with all the essentials to get you going.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":79,"width":539,"height":514} -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, finally, an <strong>under-20k-starter</strong> for your future vampire spouse</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":80,"width":549,"height":522} -->

<p>At that, you now have the tools to get your game underway!</p>
