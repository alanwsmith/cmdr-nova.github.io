<p>It's been a while, or maybe a long time (months, and months at this point), since I've released a really in-depth sort of product in <a href="https://marketplace.secondlife.com/stores/165186" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my Second Life store</a>. From a time, way back when in the early days of 2015, when I used to post a new product every other day, non-stop, constantly, to now, where just <em>making</em> the product takes me days, weeks of time. And then posting it? Hours of time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It gets a little daunting in my head if I don't just force myself to do it, because I do, after all, enjoy doing these things. Just like I do writing, creating music, and so on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So today, I bring you the Nano Nexus Gym Shorts: Glitch Edition.</p>

<p>This pair of shorts is 100% mesh, fit for the Maitreya, Legacy, and eBody Reborn bodies. Currently it comes in this variation, a yellow and black color, with green and purple glitch effect, and black text around the waist the reads, "Error."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More variations are planned, but by doing things like this in variations, it becomes a much less daunting task for my undertaking, while doing all of the other things that I do!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can check out these shorts right here in your internet browser, <a href="https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/REVOSA-Nano-Nexus-Glitch-Edition/25672435" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.
