Alright, so this latest chapter sees the end of an important figure, or someone who has been relatively important throughout the entire series so far, and then we're introduced to something familiar, yet maybe strange for such a setting that I have developed here.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, I hope the reception of this particular aspect of the story is received well, because I can, and am going to have a lot of fun in developing it.<br />
<br />
I am of course talking about vampirism, and although it isn't directly named or mentioned as such, that is exactly what it is. I used to have lots and lots of fun roleplaying in vampire settings in a modern sort of way, and I had a lot of ideas and character progression that I think kicked tons of ass. But, being as this was a simple roleplay setting, that work that I did would never really see the light of day in actual storytelling.<br />
<br />
Well, until now at least.<br />
