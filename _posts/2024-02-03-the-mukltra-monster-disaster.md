<p>Over the past twenty four hours, the instance over at mkultra.monster experienced ... somewhat of a disaster of sorts. A disaster that resulted in the deletion of the original instance I had setup, and the installation of a new version.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But what happened?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As mentioned in the beginning of the post, this took place over the past day. At one point my account got followed by a user on the instance px.mathias777.com, and it didn't shoot up a red flag immediately, but I did notice around this exact same time, my instance basically stopped being as chatty as it usually is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not that I have any members (currently) other than myself, but federation slowed down considerably. It took me another eight or so hours to notice that it had actually stopped completely, and nothing was being received from the fediverse at all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's <em>possible</em> the user on this instance wasn't the cause, and this was just a massive coincidence, but I somehow doubt that. As the instance was experiencing zero issues until that point.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I added the instance to a server wide block far too late, and upon trying to restart and recover what I could was useless. And, unfortunately, so were the backups.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thankfully, I'm the only one on the instance. But I <em>would</em> really like to know how this happened. How a single user from another instance essentially killed mine. It's baffling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But I will be reviewing ways to stop this from happening in the future, as I am paying for this out of pocket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As of right now mkultra.monster is back to functioning properly ... hopefully for the foreseeable future.</p>
