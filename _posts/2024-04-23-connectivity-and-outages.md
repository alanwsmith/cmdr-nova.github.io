<p>So here I am writing a new blog post in my notes app, because both ATT and Verizon are experiencing outages. Writing in my notes app, on my phone, because without connectivity, my notes aren’t syncing with the cloud, and both my PC and laptop can’t retrieve them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because of these simultaneous outages, it’s basically impossible to find out why, but it brings up something of a stark realization.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have one 5g bar, connectivity is off and on, and the network is completely out. It takes about five minutes to send someone a message, and repeated refresh requests to get a website to load. It makes me realize that our infrastructure is woefully unprepared for disaster. Had this been some kind of attack that knocked out a few networks, I’m suddenly seeing that both of these companies have&nbsp;<em>no contingency</em>. No backup connection, no placeholder.&nbsp;<strong>Nothing.</strong></p>

<p>The internet goes out and your cell service is near unreachable. Guess what? You may as well be marooned in space.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But we have corporations out here pouring every resource they have into developing content theft algorithms, because that’s what’s important.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the least worst case scenario, you’re in my position. Spending your remaining time off from work watching downloaded YouTube videos you ripped months ago. In the worst case scenario, you’re in an emergency and suddenly everything goes out. The next text message you send takes five minutes to go through and who knows if that’s quick enough to resolve whatever you’re experiencing.</p>

<p>I’m one person with hardly a voice to speak of, but something’s gotta change</p>
