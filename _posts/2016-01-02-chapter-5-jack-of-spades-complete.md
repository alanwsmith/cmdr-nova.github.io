After some time and some interruptions for other things that needed to happen, including the holiday season and some new games that are pretty cool, I got back to chapter five and finished it today!<br />
<br />
In chapter five, instead of having the Tredecim's ship AI just talk for a whole chapter about how and why everyone on the vessel is dead, I decided to do something a little different and take the reader through the perspective of one of the biggest antagonists in the series, Jack Marcellus.<br />
<br />
He's violent, he's bad. There isn't a single redeeming quality left in this man, but it was essential for establish what happens next, in chapter six, "<i style="font-weight: bold;">Bloodlust</i>."<br />
<br />
I've made a few new decisions about what's going to happen next in this book, and what I'm going to do with these characters. It might actually come out looking controversial but it's something I've always wanted to do in fiction and I figured, why not do it now?<br />
<br />
Until then, <a href="http://nbserial.tumblr.com/post/132651011541/netherbound-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click here</a> and head on over to the Tumblr index page and check out chapter five! Or, if you haven't read any of it yet, start from the beginning. Just be forewarned that anything written on Tumblr is considered rough draft material and completely subject to changes once the initial first draft is completed.<br />
<br />
Here's hoping everyone had a wonderful holiday and a bright beginning to a new year!
