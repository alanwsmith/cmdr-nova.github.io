<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To start my vacation from work, and my switch from position to position, building to building, I spent about seven total hours setting up my own Mastodon instance. An instance you can now view,<a href="https://mkultra.monster/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> right here</a>. I first launched an instance through masto.host, but ultimately decided that I prefer full control.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not just full control over who joins, and what gets limited and suspended, but also control over how much space I have, what resources I'm using, and how I set it up, and when I take it down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, to add to that, I decided to fiddle with Wordpress. And after a few hours of messing with plugins (ActivityPub being one of them), and setting up a basic design with a bunch of non-functioning links (at the moment), I've decided this ... is my new website!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, this post <em>should</em> show up on the Mastodon feed as a post, and hopefully not in its full text. Part of making this update is, making sure my website has one update to start, and also to see what happens when this hits the fediverse.</p>
