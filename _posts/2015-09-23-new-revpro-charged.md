Today we have a car that I was building as a custom tuner (looks a lot like a Dodge Charger) for my original first customer from way back a year or so ago when my business was called "greasfox." This is your standard muscle car, modified for precision drifting and, with the right settings, grip. What's drift? Find me inworld and I'll show you.<br />
<br />
This may or may not be the last vehicle I release. Since REVOSA began, I've slowly moved from building vehicles to creating things from scratch in Blender, things that range from technology all the way to pizza! It would be fair to say that I'm a bit burned out on car building and tuning.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, this vehicle is just as cool as my previous five releases!<br />
