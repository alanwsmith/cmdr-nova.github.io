<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>How has a failure, or apparent failure, set you up for later success?</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In my lifetime I’ve failed many times, and I’ve had many successes. There are things I fail at more than others, but the one big takeaway is that failure precludes success.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
