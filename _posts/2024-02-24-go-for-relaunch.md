<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A little over a week ago, I was feeling pretty overwhelmed with the costs of running both my Wordpress <em>and</em> a Mastodon server via Digital Ocean. The nature of Mastodon is that, the more you federate, the more media your server needs to store, the more bandwidth you use, and the higher your costs go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm already paying for a Second Life sim, and a bunch of other things!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was, at first, feeling a bit panicky, and shut it all down. But after a brief thought in a more clear mind, I put my Mastodon instance back via toot.io managed hosting, and then re-installed my Wordpress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the way I think I like it for now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tumblr is less and less of a blogging solution, especially with the recent debacle, and there's just something ... more special, about running your own website, on your own server.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That aside, I have some thinking to do. For the past, well, <em>over</em> a year, I've been running a sim in Second Life, entirely out of my own pocket. I can continue to do this at my own expense, but I'm making no profit, and drawing in visitors, or even people who want to <em>stay</em> is proving to be quite the project.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One I'm increasingly maybe feeling like I don't need to be helming. BUT, I do <em>like</em> having my own entire sim with 30,000 land impact to mess with.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is something to think about though, going forward.</p>
