<p>I was twenty-eight years old when Dragon Age Inquisition came out. It was right after the triumph (or catastrophe?) of the ending to the Mass Effect trilogy. I still remember that day ... the Normandy crash landing on some jungle planet, and then cut to black. And we're still waiting on a sequel to that, twelve years later.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of sequels that have taken far longer than they should, I've finally sat down to take in the opening minutes and official trailer of the game formerly known as Dragon Age Dreadwolf. Look, I ... I have some thoughts. And I'm aware that not all of them are the popular opinion in regard to Dragon Age games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But I was there when Origins came out, and it was one of the greatest experiences I'd ever had in gaming. The concept of affecting the opinions of my companions, and even romancing them, was a foreign thing to me. So, imagine my surprise, for the very first time, when I found out you could <em>sleep</em> with Morrigan. As long as you were enough of an asshole to please her sensibilities ... <em>and then bear a child with her.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think I spent hundreds of hours in that game, and I didn't even play any of the DLC at the time. I didn't do that until years later, when I finally beat Dragon Age 2 and Inquisition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Funny story: Dragon Age 2 didn't feature the Gray Warden, it was some new character named Hawke. I <em>hated this</em>, and intentionally avoided ever playing it until about five or six years ago from today. The same goes for Inquisition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I specifically avoided two entire sequels to Dragon Age Origins, because they took the world, story, and character that were established, and that I was attached to, and put them in the trash can. <em>And then they did that again</em>, once you finally relented and played DA2, and <em>maybe</em> became attached to Hawke as a main character. They took them and also put them in the trash can.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was my state of mind, the whole entire time, because I was <em>also</em> a major fan of the Mass Effect trilogy, where you were allowed to become attached to the world and characters, because <em>they actually continued, through each game</em>. And no, I don't expect Shepard to return in Mass Effect 4. I'm talking about here what makes logical sense to a story, if a character isn't presumed dead, and also has an active goal as the credits roll.</p>

<p>Enter: The Inquisitor, and the Inquisition.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I cannot stress enough, I was <em>very</em> reluctant to play this game. In fact, I <em>only</em> finally picked it up, once I found out that you could get a glimpse of your Hawke in the game, and a slight mention of your Gray Warden through the return of Morrigan, who, for all intents and purposes, should have brought the Warden along for the journey, depending on the ending you had in Origins, plus the Witch Hunt DLC. But, it seems BioWare is entirely allergic to my wishlist as a gamer in regard to their Dragon Age titles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm not even saying they would have had to continue with the Gray Warden completely through each game. It's understandable, that after some time, <em>maybe</em> someone else would take over. But what I wanted most through each game, was a real, <em>direct</em> continuation of the world and story, instead of this constant indirect, ham-fisted, <em>years later</em> state of the world that they keep latching onto. The plot point that continues, today, in ... uhm, The Veilguard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, of course, you guessed it ... yet another brand new main character, that, if the trailer and opening gameplay are anything to go by, <em>completely</em> ignore the Inquisitor. I'm just not okay with that, dude. The literal <em>end</em> of Dragon Age Inquisition (if you play through all of the DLC) has your Inquisitor and pals heading off to seek out Solas, and stop him from tearing down the veil.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Which makes the opening gameplay recording all the more frustrating. At this point, I'm convinced that Varric is meant to be the main character who actually appears in all four games, and that <em>sucks</em>. It sucks, because he's not <em>your</em> character, or, at this point, <em>characters</em>. And then, this guy who BioWare has been dragging through each title as some kind of storyteller who chronicles what's happened, has the audacity to say, "This crew needs a leader, someone we can count on."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bro, <em>you had that leader</em> ... THREE TIMES. And one of them had <em>already</em> set out to accomplish what you're attempting in this "years later" continuation of the story.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think the biggest slap in the face in both the official trailer and the opening minutes of gameplay is that <em>there is absolutely no mention</em> of the Inquisitor WHATSOEVER. There's a side character from Inquisition who joins your squad, and later, a random Gray Warden, but your characters, who <em>are</em> heroes, and already established? They're just gone, who knows where they are? Maybe they're having some lemonade on a beach while the world falls apart.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Dragon Age 2, the transition to Hawke at least made a little sense, and in Inquisition, maybe that made some sense too. It was at least made less bad by the inclusion of <em>some</em> mention of your previous characters. But, if what they've shown us so far for Veilguard is anything to go by, you may as well just assume the first party that set out to stop Solas <em>are all dead</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's just the biggest question, especially watching this reveal trailer: Why the <em>hell</em> is Varric forming a NEW party?! I'll say for the third time, there was ALREADY a party formed and pursuing Solas!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I won't show exact details and recordings of this ending in Inquisition, because I'm sure there are people who haven't yet played it, who want to see it for themselves. But, I think maybe at this point I'm just getting a little bit fatigued with BioWare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm 39 now, and I'm sure I'll probably be 45 by the time we get the gameplay trailer for Mass Effect 4, which I'm sure will probably feature some characters besides Liara, who knew of Shepard. And then some new character who has no idea what's going on. Just like in the abandoned Andromeda sequel, that was at least <em>kinda</em> cool, as a restart to the series.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To the people who are fine with this, I just wanna know <em>how</em> you can excuse this patchwork story-telling that has abandoned your characters three times now, especially considering what you may already know if you've fully completed Inquisition.</p>
