<p>I've avoided writing anything for a bit, maybe a week or so, or more? I lose count of days sometimes. I haven't really written much for my book, and I've made drafts on here but haven't published. I think it's mostly to do with my writing-brain needing constant breaks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that's beside the point, because recently I made the full-switch away from Windows 11 straight to Debian 12. After a lot of troubleshooting, and figuring out why the setup I'm using has been having and causing errors, issues, and problems, I can finally say that it is completely stable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Completely stable, a day after I ordered a brand new Linux-based system from <a href="https://system76.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">System76</a>. But that's okay, I've been due for a new machine for a long time, and laptops can only go so far.</p>

<p>I'm a little skeptical of what Pop!_OS will be like, because I've been a Debian user for a long time. Back in 2016/2017, I had an ancient 2011 laptop loaded with a really old version of Debian called "Jessie Debian" or something along those lines. If I do a little Google search, it seems that this was the name of Debian 8.0. As we are now on the sleek and smooth Debian 12 I can confidently say that I and also Debian have come a long way.</p>

<p>I wanted to write this, though, mostly to cast a little light on the user experience with Linux and Debian in-general, because I know a lot of people are afraid of the operating system, and how hard it might be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hint: It's not hard at all.</p>

<p>If you're like me, and you're skeptical, to angry about "AI" overtaking every aspect of the internet, and everything you do, and mostly entirely without consent (see: Microsoft baking an AI directly into your desktop), then you, too, might like to switch to Linux.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don't sweat distributions, don't go looking around for the best this, the best that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grab a copy of Debian from <a href="https://www.debian.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debian.org</a>, make a bootable flash drive, and install that thing, bro. Debian is the preem distro, the "you don't have to worry about it" distro. Your drivers? They're there. Most of your apps? Also there. And if they aren't, there are alternatives. And also alternatives you don't have to pay for! In fact, a lot of Linux is just open and free, with no endless subscriptions for crap you don't need.</p>

<p>I still have yet to find a DAW (music making type of program), but I'm sure one exists. And I'm sure It's worthwhile to find something that doesn't cost thousands of dollars to use and maintain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the biggest piece of advice I could give in escaping the death grips of the dying Windows platform, is to just <em>make the switch</em>. Just do it. Don't put up with Microsoft harvesting your data for a fad that will absolutely be dead in a few years, just like the NFT bubble. Don't wait for all the major corporations to come out and apologize for stealing every ounce of your being for puke-machines that produce garbage.</p>

<p>Just switch and fuggaboutit.</p>
